Wave reflection/refraction simulation displaying the reflection and refraction of light when light transfers to mediums with different refractive indices. The change in refractive indices does not affect the reflected light but does affect the refracted light. Adhering to Snell's law, the refracted light will bend towards the normal when going from a lower to higher refractive index, while it will bend away from the normal when going from a higher to lower refractive index. Air has a refractive index of 1.0003, while glass has an index of 1.52 and water has an index of 1.33.
